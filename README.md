Similarly, you can compile the code by simply cloning the github repository into a new project and then making sure the cmake list includes all the files from the project
as well as switching the target from main to to the project name (go to the left hand side from the run button and switch from the main to the project name)

In order to run it would make sense to also implement a while loop that handles the list for a long period of time on top of making the list object in name
